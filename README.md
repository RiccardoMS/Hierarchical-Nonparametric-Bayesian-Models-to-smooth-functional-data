# Hierarchical-Nonparametric-Bayesian-Models-to-smooth-functional-data
Project carried out during Bayesian Statistics course of PoliMi, 2021.

This repository contains a CPP implementend version of Gibbs Sampler for the following Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Model:

It was designed in order to carry out a task of functional smoothing for grouped data, in particular to estimate the step functional component of sport performances 
data contained in the Shotput Dataset. Please refer to the Project Report for details about context and further research.

Repository contais also implementations of Gibbs Samplers designed for slightly different models. Refer to specific Readme files for their formulations and purposes.

Please note that the Shotput Dataset is not provided, but all the code can be tested using simulated data available in the repository.
